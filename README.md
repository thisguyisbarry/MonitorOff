This application is an executable that you can pin to your task bar, or place where ever you so wish. 
Upon launching the application any displays you have connected will be switched off, and the vast majority of input will be ignored to avoid switching on your monitor. 
Any input that would wake up your screen will not do so. The scroll lock button will be used to wake your monitor back up.

This is useful for example if you wish to keep your monitors in standby while playing some sound from your computer, but still wish to be able to control media volume.
