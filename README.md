This application is an executable that you can pin to your task bar, or place where ever you so wish. 
Upon launching the application any displays you have connected will be switched off, and the vast majority of input will be ignored to avoid switching on your monitor. 
The only inputs that will be accepted will be F12 to turn back on your monitor, or any volume settings.
