This application is an executable that you can pin to your task bar, or place where ever you so wish. 
Upon launching the application any displays you have connected will be switched off, and the vast majority of input will be ignored to avoid switching on your monitor. 
Any input that would wake up your screen will not do so. The scroll lock button will be used to wake your monitor back up.

This is useful for example if you wish to keep your monitors in standby while playing some sound from your computer, but still wish to be able to control media volume. 

Further work to investigate:
I want to see if I can make windows ignore inputs in general. Monitors will wake, but go right back into standby so you may see them go back into standby.

Also just the sleep delay seems a little inefficient so I'll look into what can change there.

If anyone is feeling extra committed, a simple gui to change which key input would be cool.
